# ðŸ¥ž MinStack Implementation in Java

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **MinStack** data structure in Java.  
Along with the standard stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `top`),  
it also supports retrieving the **minimum element** in constant time `O(1)`.

## ðŸš€ Features
- `push(x)` â†’ Insert an element into the stack.  
- `pop()` â†’ Remove the top element from the stack.  
- `top()` â†’ Get the top element of the stack.  
- `getMin()` â†’ Retrieve the minimum element in the stack in `O(1)` time.
